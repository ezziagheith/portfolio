# Ezzia's Portfolio

## Technologies Used

* jQuery 
* jQuery UI
* bootstrap
* github 
* CSS
* javascript
* HTML

## Process/Approach

* I looked at plenty of different portfolio examples before starting to brainstorm my own portfolio. I took notes of what I liked from other portfolios, thought of a theme and began to put my ideas into code! This is version 1 of my portfolio, I definitely would love to improve and work more on it!ANCHOR 


## Biggest Wins and Challenges

* A challenge of mine was getting the puzzle pieces to work, I found an example online and tried to follow it, but I did not like the way it turned out. After researching some more, I found a function that will fix the puzzle pieces the way I liked it, in two lines of code, rather than 50 lines like I was doing earlier.

* After figuring it out and turning out the way I imagined it, I felt very happy and felt like a winner!ANCHOR
